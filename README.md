            ðŸ§  Stroke Prediction Using Machine Learning

Stroke is a serious medical condition caused by interrupted blood flow to the brain, leading to brain cell damage or death. It is one of the leading causes of disability and mortality worldwide. Early prediction can help identify high-risk individuals and enable timely medical intervention.

This notebook presents a machine learning pipeline to predict stroke risk using patient data that includes age, glucose levels, BMI, smoking habits, and medical history. The workflow includes:

- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering based on clinical guidelines (CDC, WHO)
- Feature selection using ANOVA F-statistics
- Handling class imbalance with SMOTE
- Model training with Logistic Regression, MLP, Random Forest, and XGBoost
- Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
- Ensemble modeling with soft voting
- Model explainability using SHAP values
